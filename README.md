# Custom Q&A Chatbot

This project builds a Question-and-Answer (Q&A) chatbot powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and embedding models. It aims to understand uploaded PDF documents and provide accurate, context-aware responses.

The team prepared and processed text data by extracting content from PDFs, creating embeddings, and constructing a vector datastore as the chatbotâ€™s knowledge base. A user-friendly web interface was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to support real-time interaction and ensure a smooth user experience.
